Pagination System:

10 posts/pages per row.
Navigation buttons: "Next", "Previous", and page numbers in the center for easy navigation.
Total Count & Issue Tracking:

Display the total number of posts/pages.
Track the number of issues on each post/page.
Show the number of issues that have been solved for each post/page.
Solved Issues Visibility:

Once an issue is solved, it will no longer appear on the post/page.
Only unresolved issues will be displayed on the post/page.
Filter Feature:

Ability to filter posts/pages based on solved or unsolved issues.
Filter options to sort by status (Solved/Unsolved) for better organization.

Database Details:
Table Name: auto_sums

This table will store the scan records for each post or page.
Columns in auto_sums Table:

ID (Primary Key): Auto-incrementing unique identifier for each record.
post_id: ID of the post or page being scanned (foreign key to WordPress posts table).
scan_date: Date and time when the post/page was scanned.
issues_found: Number of SEO issues found during the scan.
issues_solved: Number of SEO issues that were fixed during the scan.
focus_keyword: The focus keyword for the post/page.
meta_description: The meta description for the post/page.
slug: The SEO-friendly URL slug of the post/page.
api_status: Status of connected APIs during the scan (e.g., "Active," "Expired").
content: The content of the post/page analyzed during the scan (can be limited to prevent large data).
Functionality:

When a post or page is scanned:
Check if the record exists: If the post/page has already been scanned, delete the previous record.
Insert new scan data: After deleting old records, insert the new data (including SEO results, focus keyword, issues found, etc.).
Optimized Queries:

Use optimized SQL queries (INSERT INTO, DELETE, and UPDATE) to manage records.
Indexes should be used for columns like post_id to speed up lookups.
Only necessary columns should be stored to avoid performance issues with large datasets.
When Scanning a Post/Page:

The old record (if any) will be deleted.
A new record will be inserted into the table with updated scan data.
Cron Jobs or Background Tasks:

Scanning can be handled in background tasks or scheduled via WordPress cron jobs to prevent performance issues when scanning large sites.
Use AJAX to avoid blocking the frontend and allow scans to run asynchronously.
Performance Considerations:
Efficient Database Queries:

Ensure that optimized database queries are used to handle the scan results, especially when dealing with large datasets.
Use indexes on commonly queried fields like post_id to speed up searches and updates.
Handling Background Processes:

Perform background processing for heavy tasks such as API calls and content analysis. This ensures that the main website frontend is not affected by the scanning process.
Use AJAX or WordPress cron jobs to execute scans asynchronously.
Reducing Redundant Operations:

Avoid performing the same scan for posts/pages multiple times unnecessarily. Store previous scan results in the database to prevent redundant calculations.
Use caching mechanisms where possible to avoid recalculating results for unchanged posts/pages.
Caching Results:

Store scan results in the WordPress transient cache to quickly retrieve the results for posts that have already been scanned.
This helps reduce database load when posts are frequently visited.
Limit Data in Database:

Avoid storing excessive amounts of data (e.g., entire post content) in the database unless necessary. This will help with database performance as the website grows.
Store only relevant SEO data such as focus keyword, issues, and meta descriptions.
Use Background Processing for Heavy Tasks:

Implement background tasks for things like duplicate content checks, grammar analysis, and SEO issue detection. This prevents the plugin from blocking the user interface while performing these operations.
Optimize Plugin Code:

Keep the code modular and efficient, following WordPress coding standards to ensure that the plugin does not negatively impact website performance.
Use lazy loading techniques to only load necessary resources when required.
Database Cleanup:

Periodically clean up old scan records from the database to avoid bloat. For example, you can keep records for the last few scans of each post and delete older ones.
